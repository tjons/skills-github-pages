# Book notes

I'm a pretty big reader -- I usually have 3-4 different books in-progress at any given time. I dabble in any genre, but particularly enjoy reading books about history, tech, science, and programming. 

Unfortunately, as life has gotten busier, I've started reading less. In addition, I find that when I do read, I can often tend to forget much of what I read and my memory isn't quite as photographic as it used to be. There are myriad reasons that I think are at the root of this, and I suspect that being constantly immersed in digital distractions is probably the most significant cause. 

To help remember important parts of books, I've tried lots of different strategies. Reading aloud, using a highlighter, taking notes, audiobooks, and more. I have found that for technical books, I remember and digest information best when I read with a highlighter or pen and take notes on important topics. 

I'm going to start posting my reading notes here. I anticipate this will help me do several things:
1. Build up content for my new website
2. Be able to access my (published) notes anywhere I have an internet connection
3. Be able to take advantage of markdown formatting to better track code snippets
4. Learn in public and hold myself accountable to keep reading and taking notes.

Currently, I'm focusing on two books, [_Concurrency in Go_ by the outstanding Katherine Cox-Buday](https://amzn.to/3WXfxER)* and a book about American Interventionism in the Middle East whose name escapes me at the moment! I'll focus on sharing notes from _Concurrency in Go_ for now. I'm currently on Chapter 3, so I'll start by uploading my notes from the first two chapters. Shoot me a [Tweet/Xeet](https://x.com/tylerschade) if you want to discuss or follow along.
